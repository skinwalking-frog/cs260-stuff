Due to the way most methods for the list function, testing is not very easy without rewriting the main code. 
for now ignore tests.cpp and do not include it when compiling. 

Add function: 30-94             O(n)
remove function: 97-150         O(n)
peek function: 135-184          O(n)

all functions seem to have a complexity of no more than O(n) since they longest thing they do is loop through the list once
